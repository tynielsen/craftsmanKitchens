						<p>OUR STORY begins 45 years ago when Craftsman Kitchens &amp; Baths was one of the largest cabinet companies in the inter-mountain west. Owned by St. Charles (a metal cabinet company) Craftsman was the wood line of cabinetry for that company.</p>
						<p>In 1985 Chris Woodward purchased Craftsman Kitchens from St. Charles and began building a new business. In the coming years, Craftsman grew from a 2 car garage shop, to the premier custom cabinet facility in the state. In 2004, Craftsman completed it's beautiful showroom in South Salt Lake. Among rows and rows of cinder block buildings, Craftsman added the same element to their beautiful building that you will find in all aspects of their business - Realization That Exceeds Your Expectations.</p>
						<p>After years of continuing success, Craftsman caught the attention of another company and was purchased at the climax of the economy in late 2007. In the soon to come months, the economy began it's collapse and the commitments we had from nationwide dealers did not come through. Everyone went into "survival mode" and could not bring on a new line of high end cabinets. During that time, Craftsman did well with it's continuing clients and the St. Regis Resort in Deer Valley (see video).</p>
						<p>It was not enough to support the massive overhead that was invested. In late 2009, the opportunity came for Craftsman to go back to it's former facility at the showroom where they built their name for years on end. Thanks to some good people and good companies, Craftsman re-established exactly as it was before it was purchased in 2007 with it's employees and machinery. For obvious reasons, we had to establish under a new name, Craftsman Kitchens, LLC.</p>
						<p>Rather than fold up on our valued customers and vendors, Craftsman continued and finished all remaining contracts during the process. In a few short months we also paid off all the vendors with balances from the previous entity.</p>
						<p>Today, Craftsman continues to build the finest cabinetry around. We continue to succeed by evolving with the needs of clients. When you are ready for a new experience in design and service with someone who is truly passionate about turning your designs into reality, come see the experts at Craftsman Kitchens.</p>
